# Measles School Simulation Template[^original]

[^original]: This template is based on the original joint work by the Utah Department of Health and the University of Utah with support from the CDC.

> [!CAUTION]
> The code and model are still under development. We would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. Please open an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/measles-school-letters) if you have any questions or suggestions.

This repository contains a template for conducting measles outbreak scenario modeling for schools. The code provides tools to simulate disease spread under different vaccination rates and intervention scenarios.

## Getting Started

### For Testing/Demonstration (Using Synthetic Data)

To test the repository with synthetic data:

```bash
TEST_DATA=TRUE make sims
TEST_DATA=TRUE make reports
```

This uses the included `test_school_vax_data.csv` with 3 synthetic schools (~500 students each, 80% vaccination rate).

### For Production Use

1. **Replace data file**: Create `school_vax_data.csv` with your actual school vaccination data (see format requirements below)

2. **Replace letterhead**: Replace `letter_head.docx` with your organization's letterhead template

3. **Run the simulation and report generation**:

    ```bash
    make sims
    make reports
    ```

    Or manually run the scripts in sequence:

    ```bash
    R CMD BATCH 00-simulation_data.R 00-simulation_data.Rout
    R CMD BATCH 01-generate_reports.R 01-generate_reports.Rout
    ```

For testing with synthetic data, you can set the environment variable `TEST_DATA=TRUE`:

```bash
TEST_DATA=TRUE make sims
TEST_DATA=TRUE make reports
```

### Required Data Format

Your production CSV file must be named `school_vax_data.csv` and contain these columns:
- `SchoolID`: Unique identifier for the school
- `Name`: School name
- `enrolled_students`: Total number of enrolled students
- `Students up to date with MMR`: Number of students with up-to-date MMR vaccination
- `Grade_level`: Grade level (Elementary, Middle, High, or School for mixed)
- `school_district`: Name of the school district
- `Health District`: Name of the health district
- `PUBLIC/PRIVATE`: School type
- `Chartered?`: Whether school is chartered (Yes/No)
- `inperson/online`: Learning mode ("In person or hybrid" for in-person schools)
- `Address`, `City`, `Zip Code`, `County`: Location information
- `r_school_code`: School code for reference

**Note**: The file can include comments (lines starting with `#`) which will be ignored when loaded into R.

### Required Template File

Your production letterhead template must be named `letter_head.docx` and should contain your organization's official letterhead formatting.

## Repository Structure

### Main Scripts
- [`00-simulation_data.R`](00-simulation_data.R) - **Main simulation script**. Runs the measles outbreak simulations for each school and saves results. **Run this script first.**
  - Uses [`params.yaml`](params.yaml) - Model parameters for the simulations
  - Reads either `school_vax_data.csv` (production) or `test_school_vax_data.csv` (testing) based on `TEST_DATA` environment variable
  - Generates [`simulation_data.csv`](simulation_data.csv) - Simulation results in CSV format
  - Generates [`simulation_data.rds`](simulation_data.rds) - Same results in R data format

- [`01-generate_reports.R`](01-generate_reports.R) - **Report generation script**. Creates individual Word document reports for each school. **Run this after generating simulation data.**
  - Uses [`measles.qmd`](measles.qmd) - Quarto template for generating reports
  - Uses [`letter_head.docx`](letter_head.docx) - Word template with your organization's letterhead
  - Outputs reports to [`reports/`](reports/) directory, organized by health district

- [`02-split_simulated_LHD.R`](02-split_simulated_LHD.R) - **Optional utility script**. Splits simulation data by health district and saves as separate CSV files

### Required Input Files

- **`school_vax_data.csv`** - Your school vaccination data (production use)
- **`test_school_vax_data.csv`** - Synthetic test data with 3 schools (included for testing)
- **`letter_head.docx`** - Your organization's letterhead template (replace for production use)

### Supporting Files

- [`scripts/`](scripts/) - Supporting R functions
  - [`scripts/model_functions.R`](scripts/model_functions.R) - Core epidemiological model functions
  - [`scripts/docx_edit.R`](scripts/docx_edit.R) - Functions to edit Word documents and highlight key statistics in red and bold

- [`reports/`](reports/) - Output directory for generated reports (see [reports/README.md](reports/README.md) for details)

- [`Makefile`](Makefile) - Build automation with targets: `sims`, `reports`, `clean_reports`, `clean_sims`, `clean_all`

## How the System Works

### 1. Data Loading and Environment Detection

The system automatically detects whether to use test or production data:

- **Test mode**: When `TEST_DATA=TRUE`, uses `test_school_vax_data.csv` (3 synthetic schools)
- **Production mode**: When `TEST_DATA` is unset or `FALSE`, uses `school_vax_data.csv` (your real data)

### 2. Simulation Process

```mermaid

    A[Load school data] --> B[Clean and aggregate by school]
    B --> C[Filter schools >10 students, >30% vax rate]
    C --> D[Run measles simulations for each school]
    D --> E[Save results to simulation_data.csv]
```

The simulation runs multiple scenarios for each school:
- **Without quarantine**: Natural outbreak progression
- **With quarantine**: 21-day quarantine for unvaccinated exposed students

### 3. Report Generation Process

```mermaid

    A[Read simulation_data.csv] --> B[For each school]
    B --> C[Create temporary working directory]
    C --> D[Copy required files:<br/>measles.qmd, letter_head.docx,<br/>simulation data, etc.]
    D --> E[Render Quarto report to Word]
    E --> F[Apply text formatting:<br/>highlight key numbers in red/bold]
    F --> G[Move report to final location<br/>in reports/ directory]
    G --> H[Organize by health district<br/>if specified]
```

### 4. Output Organization

Reports are saved in the `reports/` directory:
- **With health districts**: `reports/{health_district_name}/{school_id}.docx`
- **Without health districts**: `reports/{school_id}.docx`

## Simulation Data Output Format

The `simulation_data.csv` file contains all the data needed to generate reports. Each row represents one school with the following columns:

- `id`: School identifier (format: `{SchoolID}_{r_school_code}_{Grade_level}`)
- `name`: School name
- `health_district`: Health district name (used for report organization)
- `letter_head`: Letterhead template filename (currently not used - defaults to `letter_head.docx`)
- `vax_rate`: Vaccination rate (0-1 scale)
- `pop_size`: School population size
- `no_quarantine_mean_cases`: Average number of cases without quarantine intervention
- `no_quarantine_mean_hosp`: Average number of hospitalizations without quarantine
- `quarantine_mean_cases`: Average number of cases with quarantine intervention  
- `quarantine_mean_hosp`: Average number of hospitalizations with quarantine

## Available Make Targets

Use these commands for common tasks:

- `make sims` - Generate simulation data
- `make reports` - Generate Word document reports
- `make clean_reports` - Remove all generated reports
- `make clean_sims` - Remove simulation data files
- `make clean_all` - Remove all generated files
- `make help` - Show available targets

## Testing and CI

The repository includes GitHub Actions CI that:
1. Tests simulation data generation with synthetic data (`TEST_DATA=TRUE`)
2. Validates report generation process
3. Ensures all outputs are created successfully

The CI uses a Docker container with R and required packages, demonstrating the complete workflow from data input to final reports.
