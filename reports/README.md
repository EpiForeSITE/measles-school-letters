# Reports Output Directory

This directory contains the generated measles outbreak simulation reports for schools.

## Structure

Reports are automatically generated by running the `01-generate_reports.R` script, which:

1. Reads simulation data from `simulation_data.csv`
2. Generates individual reports for each school using Quarto templates
3. Stores the reports in this directory, organized by group/district (if specified)

## File Organization

- If the simulation data includes a `group` column, reports will be organized into subdirectories by group/district
- Report files are named using the school ID format: `{school_id}.docx`
- Each report contains customized analysis and recommendations based on the school's specific vaccination rates and population size

## Generated Content

Each report includes:
- School-specific vaccination rates and population data
- Simulation results comparing scenarios with and without quarantine measures
- Probability tables for different outbreak sizes
- Hospitalization estimates
- Customized recommendations with highlighted key statistics

## Note

This directory will be populated when you run the report generation process. Ensure you have first generated simulation data using `00-simulation_data.R` before running the report generation script.
